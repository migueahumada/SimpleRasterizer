This is my custom implementation of a 3D visualizer that will eventually turn into my custom game engine.

## ► Why am I doing it?
---
Well it sounds like one of those crazy things to do but it's a nice feeling seen all the work you have put into a custom tool. This began as a project from a course I took and eventually became my favorite personal project.

### ► Third party code
---
- DirectX11 : used for 3D graphics.
- XAudio2 : used for audio playback
- SDL3 : used for window handling
- OpenCL : used for compute
- ImGui : used as GUI

### ► What's the status? 
---
Well, it's definitely a work in progress.
